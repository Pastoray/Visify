# Visify

Visify is an intuitive web-based application designed to visually represent binary trees, regardless of their size, in an interactive and engaging manner. As of today, Visify supports visualizing trees.

**_Note:_** Visify mainly visualizes binary trees. It used to support linked lists and graphs, but after some well-thought-out reflection, I decided to focus solely on binary trees. This decision was made because it made the site more intuitive and simpler, and there was no strong need for linked lists visualization. Additionally, the graph visualizations were inconsistent, but this may be revisited in the future.

## Usage

On the home page, there is one input field:

- **Trees:** Here you enter your input in the form of an array. This app assumes that the node values are organized following the **Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal**.
